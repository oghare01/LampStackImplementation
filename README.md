# LampStackImplementation

1. First, a new EC2 Ubuntu instance called 'LAMP Proj' was created in AWS as shown below.

2. Then I opened up Git Bash to connect to the AWS instance which successfully connected to the AWS server which can be seen in the below screenshot

3. Next, I installed Apache web server and confirmed that is was running successfully. The test revealed that Apache was up and running as displayed in the following image.

4. I used the curl command to test the Apache server and it gave the expected result
